# Memory Optimization Fixes for Expense Tracker

## Issues Addressed

The app was experiencing crashes in TestFlight with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)` errors in the Hermes JavaScript engine. This document outlines the memory optimization fixes implemented.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Memory leaks in useAppwrite hook** - Async operations not properly cancelled on unmount
2. **IAP service memory management** - Missing cleanup of listeners and connections
3. **Excessive concurrent data fetching** - Too many simultaneous API calls
4. **Missing dependency arrays** - Causing unnecessary re-renders and memory pressure
5. **Image handling without cleanup** - Local image files not cleaned up after use
6. **React Native version compatibility** - Some packages incompatible with React 19

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced useAppwrite Hook (lib/useAppwrite.ts)
- Added abort controllers to cancel pending requests
- Added mounted ref to prevent state updates after unmount
- Better error handling for authentication and network errors
- Proper cleanup in useEffect return functions

### 2. Improved IAP Service (lib/services/iap/iapService.ts)
- Added initialization state tracking
- Better listener cleanup in setupPurchaseListeners
- Prevented multiple initializations
- Added service state checking method

### 3. Global Provider Memory Management (lib/global-provider.tsx)
- Added mounted flags to prevent memory leaks
- Converted functions to useCallback with proper dependencies
- Better error handling in async operations
- Optimized refetch functions

### 4. Image Memory Management
- Added cleanup for local image files in transaction modals
- Proper useEffect dependency arrays
- File system cleanup on component unmount

### 5. Build Configuration Optimizations
- Updated Metro config with Hermes optimizations
- Enhanced EAS build configuration for iOS
- Memory-optimized build settings

### 6. TypeScript and Code Quality
- Fixed all TypeScript errors
- Added proper type annotations
- Removed problematic dependencies

## Build and Deploy Instructions

### For Development
```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

### For Production iOS Build
```bash
# Use the optimized build script
chmod +x scripts/build-ios-optimized.sh
./scripts/build-ios-optimized.sh

# Or use EAS directly
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## Memory Monitoring

### During Development
- Use React DevTools to monitor component re-renders
- Check Network tab for excessive API calls
- Monitor memory usage in development console

### In Production
- Use Xcode Instruments to profile memory usage
- Monitor crash reports in App Store Connect
- Test on devices with limited memory (older iPhones)

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use cleanup functions** in useEffect when dealing with:
   - Timers and intervals
   - Event listeners
   - Network requests
   - File operations

2. **Use useCallback and useMemo** appropriately:
   - For expensive computations
   - For functions passed as props
   - For dependency arrays in useEffect

3. **Monitor API calls**:
   - Avoid concurrent calls to the same endpoint
   - Implement request debouncing
   - Use loading states to prevent multiple requests

4. **Image handling**:
   - Always clean up local files
   - Optimize image sizes before upload
   - Use appropriate image formats

5. **IAP Management**:
   - Always clean up listeners
   - Check initialization state before operations
   - Handle errors gracefully

## Testing Checklist

Before each TestFlight release:

- [ ] Run TypeScript compiler with no errors
- [ ] Test on physical device with limited memory
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during heavy operations
- [ ] Test IAP functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Verify image upload/cleanup works properly
- [ ] Test offline/online mode transitions
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in React DevTools

## Monitoring in Production

Set up monitoring for:
- Crash rates (especially SIGSEGV errors)
- Memory usage patterns
- API call frequency
- User session lengths
- IAP transaction success rates

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If crashes persist:
1. Disable IAP functionality temporarily
2. Reduce concurrent API calls
3. Simplify image handling
4. Consider downgrading React Native version
